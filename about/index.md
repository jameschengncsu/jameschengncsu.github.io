I am an English singer and songwriter. I was born in 12 January 1993. I auditioned as a solo artist for the British reality television music competition The X Factor. After being eliminated as a solo performer, I was brought back into the competition, along with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson, to form the boy band One Direction.

In March 2015, I announced my departure from the band. I signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records, with my debut studio album Mind of Mine, scheduled to be released in 25 March 2016..

## Current Interests and Projects:

* Mind of Mine (2016)
* Pillowtalk (2015); number 1 in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
